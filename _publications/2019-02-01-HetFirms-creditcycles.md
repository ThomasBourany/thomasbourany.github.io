For two decades now, the macro-finance literature has explored the role of financial frictions and risk structure on liquidity and asset prices dynamics (c.f. Brunnermeier, Eisenbach & Sannikov (2012) for a survey). More recently, another literature has explored the determinants of firms investment -- e.g. idiosyncratic risk, credit frictions and non-convex adjustment cost -- and explained the procyclicality of firms dynamics (c.f. Khan and Thomas (2006, 2008, 2013) and Winberry (2018) for examples). <br/>  <br/> 

With this paper, I try to build a bridge between these two literatures to question whether firms heterogeneity implies amplification or dampening effects on assets prices and credit dynamics, in particular during recessions episodes. <br/>  <br/>

When recast in continuous time, this model also presents another example of Mean Field Games with common noise (Heterogeneous Agents model with aggregate risk). Moreover, the objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative and empirical exercise through structural estimation (SMM). <br/>  <br/>
