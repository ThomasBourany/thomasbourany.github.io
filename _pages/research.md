## **The Inequality of Climate Change and Optimal Energy Policy**. In progress, 2023

**Abstract**

Climate change, caused by rising global temperatures, will disproportionately affect developing economies while hurting relatively less the developed countries responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, what is the optimal policy design for energy taxation in the context of inequality both in impacts and levels of development? Through the lens of an Integrated Assessment Model with heterogeneous countries, I analyze the costs of global warming and the trade-off of reducing emissions. I provide characterization for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), the nature of externalities, and the second-best Ramsey policy in this framework. The main finding is that, absent lump-sum transfers across countries, the optimal carbon tax is country-specific and depends on the level of development rather the expected vulnerability of the country. Moreover, the overall level and dynamics of the tax depend on the climate dynamics, the heterogeneity in damages across regions, the redistributive effects of the energy markets between importers and exporters, as well as the path of technology. To overcome the curse of dimensionality in this heterogeneous agents model, I propose a new numerical method relying on the sequential formulation to simulate the model globally, solve for optimal policy and potentially handle aggregate uncertainty.


## **A Perturbational Approach for Approximating Heterogeneous-Agent Models**,  joint with Pr. A. Bhandari, D. Evans \& M. Golosov

**Abstract**

We develop a new perturbational technique to approximate equilibria of a broad class of stochastic heterogeneous-agent models with complex state spaces, such as multi-dimensional distributions of endogenous variables. A key insight of our approach is that it is possible to analytically characterize first, second, and higher-order approximations of the stochastic process that governs this distributional state. These characterizations have linear recursive structures, and we derive exact expressions for approximating coefficients as solutions to a small-dimensional linear system of equations. To the first order of approximation, our method is as fast and precise as existing state-of-the-art techniques that linearize heterogeneous agent models using so-called “MIT shocks,” but the ability to quickly scale to higher orders enables us to study a broader set of questions, such as the impact of risks, endogenous household portfolio formation, and welfare implications of macroeconomic stabilization policies.


## **Supply chain disruptions and risk in international trade**, joint with Ignacia Cuevas. In progress, 2023.

**Abstract**

 <i> Supply chain disruptions are becoming increasingly frequent, generating uncertainty for firms that trade internationally. Are firms taking this risk into account when choosing where to source from, by re-shoring, diversifying or changing their number and the type of suppliers they source from? To answer this question, we propose a multi-country sourcing model, inspired by Antras, Fort, and Tintelnot (2017) where firms self-select into importing based on productivity, cost minimization, and trade disruptions that increase the cost of importing. We find that even with aggregate or idiosyncratic uncertainty, a pecking order exists, and bigger firms self-select into importing from a larger set of suppliers. Nevertheless, quantitatively, risk does not seem to affect firms' sourcing strategy as much as the decrease in marginal cost that comes from increasing the set of suppliers.  </i>



### **Wealth distribution over the business cycle A mean-field game with common noise**

**Abstract**

 <i> What is the influence of firm heterogeneity on credit cycles? Are recessions amplified by the collapse of large companies or rather by the deleveraging of a multitude of small firms? This paper explores the influence of micro-level heterogeneity of firms -- in size, productivity and assets -- on the transmission of macroeconomic shocks such as financial crises. We propose a theoretical framework with heterogeneous firms that jointly analyzes firm dispersion, their power-law distribution as well as financial frictions such as collateral constraints and incomplete markets. We show that the interaction between these frictions create non-linear dynamics and further amplification effects of aggregate risks. Simulating the model using continuous-time methods and finite-difference, we consider different aggregate shocks, on aggregate productivity, aggregate demand, collateral quality and uncertainty shocks, and we explore which one has the largest impact on aggregate fluctuations. In a situation where the firm distribution is skewed with a large tail, we investigate if the granularity hypothesis of business cycles holds and show which type of firms suffer the most from recession episodes. </i>

## **Wealth distribution over the business cycle A mean-field game with common noise**
 

Master thesis written in 2018, for the Master Mathematics at UPMC-Sorbonne (M2 -- Mathematics of Modelling), in internship at Paris-Diderot University (LJLL), under the supervision of Yves Achdou.  Long version <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/MasterThesis_ThomasBourany_MFGwCommonNoise.pdf' style="color:blue"> (80 p.) here </a> with a complete description of the mathematical framework, and Short version <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/MasterThesis_ThomasBourany_MFGwCommonNoise_short.pdf' style="color:blue"> (25 pages) here </a>. 

**Abstract**
<i> The standard "Heterogeneous Agents" model -- by Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett -- has recently been reformulated as a Mean Field Game (MFG) by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions, and Moll (2017). One key question in such model is to understand the transmission of aggregate shocks – on macroeconomic dynamics or the shape of the wealth distribution. With aggregate risk, this framework can thus be understood as a MFG with "common noise". However, solving such model is notoriously difficult, due to the "curse of dimensionality" arising when common noise interact with both the behavior and the distribution of agents. Economists usually simplify the model with a finite set of moments of the measure (bounded-rationality à la Krusell-Smith) or using Projection and Perturbation methods (a\` la Reiter). In contrast, we use new methods to keep the full dimensionality and simulate the model using a discretization procedure for the common noise. Considering a tree structure or (optimal) quantization to represent the trajectories of the common noise with a finite number of shocks, we solve the MFG system using specific finite-differences methods for the two PDEs. We apply this method to the standard framework, and two extensions (i) with Endogenous Labor Supply (ii) One Asset HANK model and we provide intuitions for (iii) the two Assets H.A. model (\`a la Kaplan-Moll-Violante). We show that such method might be relevant to analyze the transmission of large shocks on the economy. </i> 


### **Fiscal policy in monetary union**

Master thesis written in 2016, for the Economic master EPP (Economics and Public Policy), under the supervision of Jean-Baptiste Michau (Ecole Polytechnique). Short version [(20 p.) here](https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Master-thesis-short-ThomasBourany.pdf) and longer version [(40 p.) here](https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Master-thesis-ThomasBourany.pdf)

**Abstract** 
<i> What are the effects of fiscal policy in a monetary union? This article explores the role of government spending, the optimal policy design and the spillovers of public spending shocks in an integrated union. I develop a two-countries New Keynesian model with "large economies", update the conclusions at stake in "small open economy" models, and provide a general framework where countries differ on many dimensions -- home-bias, agents preferences, price rigidities and labor supply. I first show that interaction effects and structural heterogeneity matter for optimal policy: the clear separation between central bank stabilizing the union and fiscal policies stabilizing country-specific shocks does not hold in this setting. Second, I identify the main transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy, with first a trade channel, through relative prices, and second a monetary response from the union central bank. The second channel largely dominates the first in this framework and spillovers of fiscal policy shocks crucially depend on the central bank mandate. This provides arguments supporting coordination between union central bank and fiscal authorities in the context of the European Monetary Union. </i>


### **Fiscal Policy and Tax compliance over the business cycle**

This paper is the result of my Research Assistantship at the French Central Bank (Banque de France -- DGEI-DERIE-SEMSI), under the supervision of researchers F. Pappada and Y. Zylberberg. We constructed a new indicator for tax compliance and studied empirically fiscal policy over the business cycle. I was in charge of the data collection and the statistical analysis, and I received for this work the <i>Prize for the Research Internship</i> from Ecole Polytechnique.

The database constructed in this project was used in the article by F. Pappad\'a and Y. Zylberberg. For more details, <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/francescopappada/austerity' style="color:blue">see here</a>.
