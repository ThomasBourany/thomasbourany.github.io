<span style="font-size:1.0em;line-height:-0em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Fighting climate change requires ambitious global policies, which are undermined by free-riding incentives. The heterogeneity in both the impacts of climate change and the costs of carbon taxation exacerbate non-cooperation, which makes the implementation of multilateral climate agreements difficult. This paper studies how to design an optimal climate club — in the spirit of Nordhaus (2015) — to maximize global welfare, incorporating strategic behavior when countries can exit climate agreements. In an Integrated Assessment Model with heterogeneous countries and international trade, I study the choice of countries in the agreement, the optimal level of carbon tax that members set on fossil fuels, and the tariffs they impose on non-members to incentivize participation. The decision balances an intensive margin — a club with few countries and large individual emission reductions — and an extensive margin — accommodating more countries at the cost of lowering the carbon tax. I find that the optimal climate club consists of all countries except Russia, a \$100 tax per ton of $CO_2$ within the club, and a 50$\%$ tariff on goods from non-members. In contrast, the globally optimal carbon tax is \$150 when free-riding is absent. In several extensions, I study additional policy instruments, such as transfers (as in the COP29), carbon tariffs (e.g. UE's CBAM), or fossil-fuel-specific tariffs, and examine the effects of trade retaliation for the stability of climate agreements.

<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> What is the optimal policy to fight climate change? Taxation of carbon and fossil fuels has strong redistributive effects across countries: (i) curbing energy demand is costly for developing economies, which are the most affected by climate change in the first place, (ii) taxation has strong general equilibrium effects through energy markets and trade reallocation. Through the lens of an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) with heterogeneous countries, I show that optimal carbon policy depends crucially on the availability of redistribution instruments. After characterizing the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), I derive formulas for second-best fossil fuel taxes in the presence of inequalities in climate damages and incomes, redistributive and distortionary effects on energy markets. I show that a uniform carbon should be reduced twofold in the presence of inequality. If country-specific carbon taxes are available, the distribution of carbon prices is proportionally related to the level of income: poor and hot countries should pay lower energy taxes than rich and cold countries. These qualitative results are general and I propose a dynamic quantitative model to provide recommendation for the optimal path of carbon tax.

**The Winners and Losers of Climate Policies: A Sufficient Statistics Approach**<br>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;line-height:-0em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong>

To combat global warming, climate policies like carbon taxes, renewable subsidies, and carbon tariffs need to be implemented to phase out fossil-fuel consumption and lower emissions. Who are the winners and losers of such policies? Through a simple Integrated Assessment Model with heterogeneous countries and international trade, we study the costs of climate change through local damages and trade spillovers in international goods and energy markets. We study both the costs of implementing those policies unilaterally and the local costs and global gains of international policy cooperation. To do so, we express and decompose these welfare changes to first order as a function of <i>sufficient statistics</i>, depending on observables and identifiable elasticities, like nations' energy mix, energy rents, trade shares, supply and demand elasticities, and damage parameters. We show that climate change has non-trivial reallocation effects through international trade in goods and energy. Pursuing unilateral policies generates strong leakage effects in goods and energy markets that are an order of magnitude larger than the gains due to reduced emissions. Finally, global climate policy cooperation has a large impact on energy markets, affecting mostly countries reliant on coal and fossil-fuel producers, causing potentially larger welfare losses for those countries than the original costs of climate change.

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> How do firms adapt their sourcing strategies when faced with supply chain uncertainty? To answer this question, we develop a multi-country sourcing model, in which firms choose where to import from, accounting for the possibility of supply-chain disruptions. We show that uncertainty introduces a positive option value, that favors diversifying the set of suppliers. However, country-specific uncertainty creates hedging motives for firms, yielding on net ambiguous predictions about sourcing decisions. We estimate the model on Chilean Customs data and we study how the recent increase in trade risk, following the Covid-19 pandemic, affected firms’ sourcing strategies. We find that the observed change in sourcing patterns results from both changes in expected costs and increased risk.</span>

**A Perturbational Approach for Approximating Heterogeneous-Agent Models**<br>
joint with Anmol Bhandari, David Evans & Mikhaïl Golosov, In progress, 2024 <br>
Draft <a href='https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54c19f18e4b0ef5f4b9f8dae/t/651ef965000c0968dcf184a0/1696528741779/BBEG_master2.pdf' style="color:maroon"> here</a> <br>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop a perturbational technique to approximate equilibria of a wide class of discrete-time dynamic stochastic general equilibrium heterogeneous-agent models with complex state spaces, including multi-dimensional distributions of endogenous variables. We show that approximating policy functions and stochastic processes that govern the distributional state to any order is equivalent to solving small systems of linear equations that characterize values of certain directional derivatives. We analytically derive the coefficients of these linear systems and show that they satisfy simple recursive relations making their numerical implementation quick and efficient. Compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, our method is faster in constructing first-order approximations and extends to higher orders, capturing the effects of risk that are ignored by many current methods. We illustrate how to apply our method to a broad set of questions such as impacts of first- and second-moment shocks, welfare effect of macroeconomic risk and stabilization policies, endogenous household portfolio formation, and transition dynamics in heterogeneous agent general equilibrium settings.

**Why HANK Matters for Stabilization Policy**<br>

Draft <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/LeGrandRagotBourany_HANK_OptimalPolicy.pdf' style="color:maroon"> here</a>. Previously titled "Non-Keynesian stabilizers and wage-price spirals"

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> We characterize jointly optimal fiscal and monetary Ramsey policies in Heterogeneous- Agent New Keynesian (HANK) economies with both price and wage rigidities. We compare aggregate allocations to Representative-Agent (RA) benchmarks. A major force drives the qualitative response of the optimal policy and the divergence between RA and HA cases: the time-varying tightness of borrowing constraints, summarized by a new sufficient statistic – the Marginal Value of the Credit Constraint (MVCC). When fiscal instruments are restricted, the MVCC rises and HA–RA gap widens. In such cases, persistent inflation becomes optimal as a costly substitute for missing labor-tax instruments.

**Heterogeneous Agents, Projection, and Aggregation: A Master Equation Approach**<br>
<span style="line-height: 1em;">In progress, 2024</span><br>
Slides (preliminary) <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Bourany_2025_Master_Equation.pdf' style="color:maroon"> here</a> 
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;line-height:-0em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> I propose a global approach to study Heterogeneous Agents (HA) models with aggregate risk. I build on the Master Equation representation, studied in the Mean Field Games literature, where the value function takes the infinite-dimensional distribution as a state variable. In that context, the projection of the distribution on a finite set of moments, as in Krusell and Smith (1998), provides analytical insights and yields finite-dimensional HJB and KFE that can be solved using standard numerical methods. I show how to preserve rational expectations to ensure that agents’ forecasts are consistent with equilibrium dynamics. This method bypasses the constraints of perturbation methods like Bilal (2023), which rely on certainty equivalence, and allows for studying aggregate uncertainty in HA models. I demonstrate the method's potential by applying it to the classic Krusell-Smith model, with substantial speed gains. I show how to implement the method with higher order moments, demonstrating how this model displays “approximate aggregation” and testing the robustness of the bounded rationality assumptions used in other methods. I also illustrate how the analysis extends to richer environments, like price-setting models or portfolio choice problems.

**The Distributional Consequences of Climate Uncertainty**<br>
<span style="line-height: 1em;">In progress, 2023</span><br>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em;">
<span style="font-size:0.9em;line-height:-0em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Future climate damages are largely unknown, due to climate system uncertainty and tipping points, as well as our lack of knowledge of its economic impacts. Moreover, the effects of this uncertainty are also heterogeneous, interacting with differences in incomes and temperatures across countries. Through the lens of an Integrated Assessment Model with heterogeneous countries and aggregate risk, I study whether uncertainty exacerbates the distributive impacts of global warming. I show analytically that the Social Cost of Carbon and the optimal carbon tax depend on the covariance of ex-ante heterogeneity due to inequality across countries and ex-post heterogeneity due to risk. Solving such models with non-linear dynamics, path-dependence, heterogeneity, and aggregate risk requires using a novel numerical method I developed relying on the Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle (SPMP). Carbon taxation provides an insurance mechanism against those climate risks – which can be substantial given the curvature of utility and damage functions.

**Energy shocks and aggregate fluctuations**<br>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0em;">
<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> How important is energy for economic fluctuations? The energy sector – e.g. oil and electricity – is complementary in industrial production processes. A decline in energy sources – due to a declining supply of fossil fuels (peak oil) – or political decisions to shrink greenhouse gas emissions – can have important implications for the macroeconomy. I analyze the contribution of shocks to the energy sector for business cycles fluctuations using a simple RBC model that features a high degree of complementarity and non-linearity in production. The first, I show that the expansion of energy supply was significant for output growth in the post-WWII period, and its decline can explain part of the slowdown in growth since the second oil shock. I show that energy shocks explain between 20 and 30$\%$ of output volatility. I study the impact of a steady increase in carbon taxation and show it could dramatically reduce economic activity depending on the renewable energy supply elasticity. I propose a multi-sector approach as an extension of this analysis.

**Credit Cycles, Asset prices and Heterogeneous Firms**<br>
<span style="line-height: 1em;">2nd year paper, 2020</span><br>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0em;">
<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> What is the influence of firm heterogeneity on credit cycles? Are recessions amplified by the collapse of large companies or rather by the deleveraging of a multitude of small firms? This paper explores the influence of micro-level heterogeneity of firms on the transmission of macroeconomic shocks such as financial crises. I propose a theoretical framework with heterogeneous firms, with a  firm distribution can be skewed with a large tail as well as financial frictions such as collateral constraints and incomplete markets. I show that the interaction between these frictions create non-linear dynamics and amplification effects of aggregate risks. Simulating the model using continuous-time methods and finite-difference, I study the impact of different aggregate shocks, aggregate productivity, demand shocks, collateral quality and uncertainty shocks, and I explore the transmission channel to aggregate economic activity.

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.85em;">
<span style="font-size:0.65em;line-height:0.1;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> A key question in "Heterogeneous Agents" model as in Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett, and reformulated as Mean Field Game (MFG) by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions, and Moll (2017), is the impact of aggregate shocks on macroeconomic dynamics or across the wealth distribution. With aggregate risk, this MFG with "common noise" is notoriously difficult to solve, due to the "curse of dimensionality". The common noise interacts with both decisions and distribution of agents, and standard methods either simplify the model or do perturbations around a stationary point. In contrast, I provide a new global method to preserve the full dimensionality and simulate the model with "large shocks". I develop a discretization procedure with a tree structure or (optimal) quantization to represent the trajectories of the common noise with a finite number of shocks and solve the MFG system using specific finite-differences methods for the two PDEs. We apply this method to the standard HA and HANK models, and I uncover a strong path-dependency of the model: such economies are typically non-Markovian. This has important implications for policy analysis when studying HA model with standard methods.

<span style="font-size: 0.65em;line-height:0.1;"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> What are the effects of fiscal policy in a monetary union? This article explores how government spending transmit across countries. I develop a New Keynesian model with two "large economies", two fiscal authorities and a central bank, to study optimal policy. I show that, with general equilibrium effects and heterogeneity, the clear separation between central bank stabilizing the union's inflation and fiscal policies stabilizing country-specific shocks does not hold. I identify the main transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy, with first a trade channel, through relative prices, and second a monetary response from the union central bank. The second channel largely dominates the first and spillovers of fiscal policy shocks crucially depend on the central bank mandate. This provides arguments supporting coordination between union central bank and fiscal authorities in the context of the European Monetary Union.
